**Introduction**

The purpose of this specification is to define the requirements and developments of the Restaurant
Delivery System. This system will keep track of delivery men, restaurant managers, clients, system
administrators, restaurant and menus.

Your application will allow Administrators to add new Restaurant, edit them and delete them. Each
Restaurant can then have a menu which can be edited and deleted. An administrator can also add a Delivery
man which can be edited and deleted (disabled). The system will handle the clients and their account. Client
can edit and close their account. They can also order a meal from a given Restaurant and view their order
history. A Manager can view the orders accepted by any Restaurant. The Restaurateur is able to view the
orders made for a giving Restaurant and take charge of it. A Delivery man can view all the Orders in his Postal
Code area, and take charge of it.

You will not be provided with any support infrastructure for this project. You will design and
implement all the classes needed to complete the Restaurant Delivery System.

```
More details about the program are provided below section.
```

**Specification**

You must implement a solution to the Restaurant Delivery System. The implementation will reflect
everything you’ve learned during this Block. You are expected to design your implementation using Object
Oriented Programming and MVC, design your own classes for representing the basic entities that the program
manipulates.

You will document your implementation in a report. The number of classes you decide to use is up to
you; however, you have to follow a set of restrictions specified below.

```
The program should be very user friendly.
```
```
Validation is a must.
Good look is a must.
